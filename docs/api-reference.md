# API Reference

Complete list of every API endpoint called by the Genesys Admin Tool, grouped by domain.

All Genesys Cloud calls are proxied through `POST /api/genesys-proxy` on the Azure Functions backend, which injects the customer-org access token. Direct calls to Genesys from the browser never occur.

## Notes

- **Pagination**: Most list endpoints use offset pagination (`pageNumber`/`pageSize`). Exceptions: External Contacts and Assistants use **cursor pagination** (`nextUri`). Task Management (Workbins/Work Types) uses **POST-based queries**.
- **Proxying**: All Genesys calls go through `POST /api/genesys-proxy`, which adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for the selected org and forwards the request to the correct Genesys region.
- **Entity name resolution**: The Audit — Search page resolves entity names for 40+ entity types by calling the appropriate `GET /api/v2/{path}/{id}` endpoint on-demand when a row is expanded.
- **Server-side endpoints**: Endpoints in sections 2, 4, 5, 7–27 that are also called from `api/lib/exports/` run server-side during scheduled export execution (including Documentation Export) — not from the browser.
- **Registered export handlers**: The `api/lib/exportHandlers.js` registry maps export type strings to handler modules. Registered types: `allGroups`, `allRoles`, `documentation`, `filteredRoles`, `interactionTotals`, `licensesConsumption`, `rolesSingleOrg`, `lastLogin`, `trustee`, `skillTemplates`.
